# Landing Page Project

This project contains a simple contact page for a website. It allows users to submit their name, email, and message through a form.

## Files Included

- **contact.html**: This file contains the HTML structure for the contact page, including a form for user submissions, a header, and a footer.
  
- **style.css**: This file contains the CSS styles for the contact page, ensuring a visually appealing design through layout, typography, and form element styling.

## How to Use

1. Open the `contact.html` file in a web browser to view the contact page.
2. Fill out the form with your name, email, and message.
3. Click the "Send Message" button to submit your information (note that the form action is currently set to `#`, so it won't actually send an email).

## Project Information

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and serves as a practice exercise for building a functional contact page using HTML and CSS.
